# Web Developer &ndash; App Team

We're looking for an experienced web developer to help shape our customer facing applications.

Location: Sendwithus HQ, Victoria BC

### Who are we?

Sendwithus is changing the way companies send email. Our core service is a simple REST API to send templated emails, powering millions of emails each day.

We believe in user experience above all else, and use customer feedback to drive all product development. Our customers are hackers, marketers, startups, and enterprises alike.

We have a welcoming technical team that works hard and is excited to build an awesome company in Victoria. Most importantly – we bring the hustle and agility of a San Francisco startup to Canada. 

### Who are you?

You love to create. You have launched a few projects on your own. You have a Github account and you read Hacker News. 

You understand the importance of visual design on customer experience. You have a detailed eye for web design. You're comfortable with CSS and Photoshop.

You're opinionated about user experience, corporate branding, and know enough javascript to be very dangerous.

You've played with a few web frameworks and tried different languages &ndash; just for fun.

You’re keen to play an important role, learn new things, write meaningful code, and build an amazing product that customers love. You inspire others to work hard, get shit done, and have fun along the way.
