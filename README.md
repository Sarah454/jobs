### Who are we?

- Sendwithus is changing the applications send email. 
- Our core product is a [simple REST API](https://www.sendwithus.com/developers) to send templated emails. 
- We're part of [Y Combinator's](http://www.ycombinator.com) W14 batch.
- We build fast, hack hard, and get shit done.

We believe in customer experience above all else. Our customers are hackers, marketers, startups, and enterprises, and we rely on all of them to drive product development.

We operate at a large scale. Maintaining a real-time API and routing millions of emails requires serious smarts, and we're excited by the challenge.
