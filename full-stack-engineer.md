# Full Stack Engineer

_Victoria BC &middot; Full-Time_

We're looking for a full stack engineer to help build new application features, scale our backend systems, and grow into a senior leader on our engineering team.

<!-- more -->

As an early engineer, you'll be on the ground floor of a rapidly growing startup. You'll learn the ins and outs of scaling a product people love while building a billion dollar company.

This is a high-impact, high-opportunity technical role. You'll be working with modern technologies to build a product that's scaling daily. You'll be talking with actual customers to create features that make a real difference.


__Who are you?__

* You have 2+ years of experience building web applications.
* You ship code quickly; we deploy several times a day.
* You have experience with modern web frameworks (Django, Rails, Express, etc.)
* You can scale a production web app beyond a single server.
* You're excited by large systems and scalable databases.
* You're comfortable with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
* You're a self-starter; if you see a problem, you'll find a way to fix it.
* You focus on product first; you care about how your code effects users.
* You're passionate about startups and want to join a small taking over the world.


__What will you be doing?__

* Working with our engineering team to design, build and scale platform features.
* Making high-level technical decisions about architecture and best practices.
* Identifying performance problems and crafting creative solutions.
* Maintaining and improving our API product.
* Separating our primary app into separate microservices.
* Interacting with customers to learn common pain points and technical requirements.


__Our Stack__

Our primary application is built using Python and Django, and is hosted on Heroku. We use Postgres, Redis, and DynamoDB to store most of our data, and prefer using hosted services whenever feasible.

We've begun moving smaller systems into separate microservices, written in Go. Our team is committed to using Go for more system tasks as we continue to scale.


__Apply__
