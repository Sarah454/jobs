# Tech Lead &ndash; Frontend

_Sendwithus HQ, Victoria BC_

We're looking for an experienced frontend web developer to help design and architect our customer facing applications, including our primary UI (the sendwithus dashboard), landing pages, and public resources.

You'll be reponsible for architecture and deployment of all user facing web content.

This is not a content or design role; you'll be leading our frontend team and
working closely with designers and product to make sure everything runs smooth and looks great.

__Who are you?__

You have a GitHub account and read Hacker News.

You know about React, Angular, and Ember and you have opinions on when to use each.

You're great at javascript, and you've built at least one production quality single page app.

You're very comfortable with CSS and HTML. You're not afraid of Photoshop.

You understand the important role visual design plays in customer experience.

You've used static website generators and deployment systems.

You're opinionated about user experience, branding and technical documentation.

Not afraid of backend code, in any language.
