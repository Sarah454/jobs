# Product Developer

### Who are we?

We’re building a killer product development team in beautiful Victoria BC, with additional opportunities in San Francisco.

Sendwithus is changing the way companies send email. Our core service is a simple REST API to send templated emails. Email templates live in our UI and can be updated and A/B tested in real-time, without code changes.

We believe in user experience above all else, and use customer feedback to drive all product development. Our customers are hackers, marketers, startups, and enterprises alike.

Most importantly – we bring the hustle and agility of a San Francisco startup to Canada. We work hard, get shit done, and have tons of fun along the way.

### Who are you?

You’ve built and launched your own projects. You have a Github account and you read Hacker News. You know what it means to build lean and iterate.

You dream of millions of users interacting with your product on a daily basis.

You’ve written code in two or more languages. You know what Twitter Bootstrap is. You’ve got at least one startup t-shirt (if not, we can fix that).

You’re excited to learn new things and write meaningful code. You work hard, get shit done, and have fun along the way.
