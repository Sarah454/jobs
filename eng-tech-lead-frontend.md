# Technical Lead, Frontend

_Sendwithus HQ, Victoria BC_

We're looking for an experienced frontend web developer to help design and architect our customer facing applications. 

You'll be reponsible for architecture and deployment of all user facing web content, including our primary UI (the sendwithus dashboard), landing pages, and other public resources.

This is not a content or design role; you'll be leading our frontend technical team and
working closely with designers and product to make sure everything runs smooth and looks great.

__Who are you?__

- You have a GitHub account and know what Hacker News is.
- You've tried frameworks like React, Angular, and Knockout and you have opinions.
- You're great with javascript, and you've built a production quality single page app.
- You're very comfortable with CSS and HTML, and not afraid of Photoshop.
- You've used static website generators and deployment systems.
- You're opinionated about user experience, branding and technical documentation.
- Not afraid of backend code, in any language.
