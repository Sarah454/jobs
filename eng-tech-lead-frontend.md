# Technical Lead, Frontend

_Sendwithus HQ, Victoria BC_

We're looking for an experienced frontend web developer to help design and architect our customer facing applications. 

You'll be reponsible for architecture and technical design of all user facing applications, including our primary UI (the sendwithus dashboard), landing pages, and other public resources.

This is not a content or design role; this is a high-impact and high-ownership technical opportunity. You'll be leading our frontend team and working closely with our product team to ensure everything runs smooth and looks great.


__Who are you?__

* You're great with javascript and have experience with production quality single-page apps.
* You ship code quickly; we deploy several times a day.
* You have experience with modern javascript frameworks like React and Angular.
* You're very comfortable with HTML and CSS, and not afraid of Photoshop.
* You've used static website generators like Jekyll and Metalsmith.
* You have a product-first approach to development; you care about how your code effects users.
* You have an eye for design and are opinionated about user experience.
* You are not afraid of backend code, in any language.


__What will you be doing?__

* Leading technical design and implementation of our main dashboard application.
* Making high-level technical decisions about architecture and best practices.
* Building technical roadmaps and prioritizing frontend development projects.
* Implementing new dashboard features in Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
* Developing static website deployment systems. 
* Talking directly with customers to learn common pain points and technical requirements.



__Our Stack__

Our current dashboard is a large single page app, built with Javascript, Coffescript, Less, and KnockoutJS. We deploy frequently using Grunt, S3, Cloudfront, and Heroku. We use Bootstrap and a CSS library for defining UI look, feel and style.

Our application backend is primarily Python, using Django and Postgres and also hosted on Heroku.
