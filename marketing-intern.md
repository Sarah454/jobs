<!-- more -->

What is “communication design”? Basically, you’ll be helping us determine the best way to present our features to potential users. We’ll be A/B testing copy, designing landing pages, and crafting interesting visual content for distribution.

 __Who are you__    
 
* You’re super interested in getting involved in a tech startup  
* You’ve had experience writing copy for blog posts or newsletters  
* You believe good design means it works for users  
* You can think in Photoshop, but build in Bootstrap  
* It really bothers you that this item breaks form from this list  
 
__What you’ll be doing__  
 
* Designing landing pages that go live the same day  
* Creating marketing assets to send traffic to those pages  
* Using analytics to determine the relative success of those pages  
* Crafting A/B tests to identify and quantify improvements  
* Generalizing what works and writing about it  

__Who we are…__  

We’re venture-backed, Canadian-born, and fresh out of Y Combinator (W14). We’re building a killer product development team in beautiful Victoria BC, with additional opportunities in San Francisco. We have a casual workplace environment with a dress code of mostly startup t-shirts and jeans. Since we are based on Vancouver Island, we love getting outside for hikes or other activities as a team. Most importantly – we bring the hustle and agility of a San Francisco startup to Canada. We work hard, get stuff done, and have tons of fun along the way.
 
__What is sendwithus…__   

Sendwithus is changing the way companies send email. Our core service is a simple REST API to send templated emails. Email templates live in our UI and can be updated and A/B tested in real-time, without code changes. We believe in user experience above all else, and use customer feedback to drive all product development. Our customers are hackers, marketers, startups, and enterprises alike.
